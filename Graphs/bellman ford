you can detect negative cycle with this algo. and bellman ford cannot be applied on graphs with neg cycle
as it will infinitely give shortest path.

djikstra algo do not givve right output for negative weights.

logic n-1 times apply 
if (dist[u] + wt < dist[v]){
    dist[v] = dist[u] + wt;
  }
  
 apply this one more time to find negative cycle.
