BFS, stands for Breadth First Search.
DFS, stands for Depth First Search.


BFS uses Queue to find the shortest path.
DFS uses Stack to find the shortest path.


BFS is better when target is closer to Source.
DFS is better when target is far from source.


BFS is slower than DFS.
DFS is faster than BFS.


Time Complexity of BFS = O(V+E) where V is vertices and E is edges.
Time Complexity of DFS is also O(V+E) where V is vertices and E is edges.




Adjacency matrix vs list

Matrix - Makes use of VxV matrix, so space required in worst case is O(|V|2).
List - For every vertex we store its neighbours. Thus, overall space complexity is O(|V|+|E|).

Matrix - quering is easy, insertion/deletion is difficult
list - query is difficult, inertion, deletion is easy.
